This is the readme for RockPaperScissors card game.

# READ ME
This project is intended to be a simplistic 2d card game developed with Unity.

## Description
The idea is that since rock paper scissors is an extremely simple game, it is a good warm up project for contributors to become accustomed to Unity, game development, and  project collaboration in general. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is really to get an idea of what it takes to put together a small game using Unity.

### Workflow
Ideally, we'll establish a base Unity / VS project then immediately branch to dev and work on assigned tasks. 
Since this project doesn't require a lot of art assets, we can move forward with development using placeholders for
just about all assets.

### Design
I think we need to decide which route to take with this game. If we implement a basic rock paper scissor game, then we don't exactly need a lot of structure since the game loop is just alternating turns between both players until a winner is determined.
If we want it to play similar to a card game, we'll need to consider traditional mechanics and how the game would be expanded. 
For example, most card games are for two or more players and generally rely on a draw one, play one flow. For Rock Paper Scissors, we could come up with additional mechanics to make the game more interesting.
* Would it be fun if the game could be played by more than two players?
* should modifier cards exist in any way? like skip a turn,  redirect 'attack',etc
